Weighted connectivity matrices (top) and binarized connectivity matrices (bottom, top 10% of strongest connections) for both morning (A and C) and evening (B and D) sessions (averaged across all participants in each session). The regions (nodes) are ordered according to which cognitive system they belong to.
